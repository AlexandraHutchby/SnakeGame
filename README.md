# SnakeGame

Kia Ora
This is a Snake Game where you use the arrow keys to move the snake around the board. You want to touch the letters - when you go over them they will be added to your snake in alphabetical order (uppercase then lowercase)
If you are to hit one of the numbers, this will remove a letter from your snake based on the index (therefore if you hit 3 the item in the 3rd index will be removed or if your snake is smaller the last letter)
Other than that enjoy the game that I created.
